- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) - A Cyber Security training site for beginner as well as advanced devs and IT professionals
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) - A highly interactive (literally you can code in the "same editor" as lecturer) code-learning platform with over a million users from all over the world
- [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) - A curated list of awesome awesomeness (need i say more?)
- [LabEx](https://labex.io) - a learning platform that provides many hands on labs for things such as Linux, Docker, and Machine Learning.
